 A stack is a more specialized queue, also known as a LIFO or last-in, first-out queue.
 It works almost exactly like a regular queue, except that elements must now join and leave 
 it through only one end called the top of the stack. The name top reflects the fact that real-world stacks tend to be vertical.

 Stacks are widely used in computing for various purposes. Perhaps the most familiar context for a programmer 
 is the call stack containing the functions in the order they were called. Python will reveal this stack to you through 
 a traceback in case of an unhandled exception. It’s usually a bounded stack with a limited capacity, which you’ll find out 
 about during a stack overflow error caused by too many recursive calls.
