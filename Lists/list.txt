A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make list that includes
the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0-9, or the names of all the people in your family.
You can put anything you want into a list the items in your list don't have to be related in any particular way.
Because a list usually contains more than one element, it's a good idea to make the name of your list plural such as
letters, digits, or names. In python, square brackets ([]) indicates a list, and individual elements in the list
are separated by commas.
